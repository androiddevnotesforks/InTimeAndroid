## What's InTime? :hourglass_flowing_sand:

InTime is a sample interval timer application using android jetpack components and a long running service.

The purpose of this project is to learn and implement new android technologies and libraries.

## Used Libraries
 - [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) 
 - [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)
 - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) 
 - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)  
 - [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) 
 - [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) 
 - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) 
 - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore)


## Architecture
This application uses the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) architecture and unidirectional data flow.

Furthermore it is a single-activity application with compose navigation handling the navigation 
graph.

## :construction: Jetpack Compose/Navigation still in development :construction:
Since compose and compose navigation are still in alpha and under development the
API is likely to change and this project subject to change.
